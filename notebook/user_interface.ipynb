    "# User Interface\n",
    "Inside this node it is implemented the user interface that allows for deciding the linear and angular velocity of the robot, to start and stop the random position behaviour, to directly command the behaviour of the robot by forcing it to go straight, backwards, turning clock-wise or counterclock-wise. It also allows to show some informations about the state of the robot such as the linear and angular velocity (set and actual), the current position and orientation of the robot, the number of goal reached and cancelled, the time to reach each goal.
